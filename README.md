# FoodHub Order Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer orders from a food aggregator service, aiming to identify trends in restaurant demand, customer preferences, and delivery performance. Using data analysis and visualization techniques, this project extracts insights that can help optimize food delivery operations and enhance user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: To handle data frames and perform data cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and efficient data processing.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and plotting charts.
- **Seaborn**: For creating enhanced visualizations and heatmaps.

## Project Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and formatted the dataset to extract meaningful insights.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted analysis to explore relationships between delivery time, food preparation time, and customer ratings.
- **Data Visualization**: Created visualizations to identify trends in order costs, delivery efficiency, and customer preferences.
- **Independent Analysis**: This project was completed independently, based on online instructions, to analyze real-world data and provide actionable insights.

## Data Description
The dataset used contains the following fields:
- **order_id**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **customer_id**: ID of the customer who placed the order.
- **restaurant_name**: Name of the restaurant.
- **cuisine_type**: Type of cuisine ordered.
- **cost_of_the_order**: Total cost of the order.
- **day_of_the_week**: Whether the order was placed on a weekday or weekend.
- **rating**: Customer rating of the order, out of 5.
- **food_preparation_time**: Time taken by the restaurant to prepare the food.
- **delivery_time**: Time taken by the delivery person to deliver the food to the customer.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FoodHub-Order-Analysis.git
    ```
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to explore the data and visualizations.

## Future Improvements
- Implement machine learning models to predict delivery times based on order data.
- Automate the data pipeline for real-time analysis of new orders.
- Integrate additional data sources to enhance predictive analytics and improve customer satisfaction.
